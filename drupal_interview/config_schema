schema- This folder is used for schema related things. This is most often used to tell Drupal how custom configurations and configuration entities will be saved.


install- The folder can contain configurations, for example a view. All configurations will be installed; if any configuration fails, the module can't be installed.


optional- The folder can contain configurations, for example a view. All configurations will be installed if possible. If a configuration has missing dependencies, it won't be installed.
Configuration installation only happens when the module itself is installed. Optional configurations can install missing configurations when dependencies are met by a new installed module.
