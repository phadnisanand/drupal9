<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

First, set up a fresh Drupal 9 installation

### Installation

The following steps are needed to set up the platform:

1. Paste the project files into a directory. Make sure the web and drush folder are in the root of the project.

2. Make sure your local domain is pointed to the web folder

3. Run ```composer install``` in the root of your installation. This will download all the required packages for the platform, and add the map structure.

4. In your settings.php, as read in the configuration management chapter, at the bottom add ```$settings['config_sync_directory'] = '../config/global';```

5. Fill in your database credentials via the UI and install your drupal site. Choose "use existing configuration"

6. Wait for the installation to finish.

7. Run ```drush offer-create-seeds``` to import all of your dummy content
