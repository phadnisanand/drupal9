The main difference between content and config entities is how they are stored and (at the moment) config entities are not fieldable (although this issue flirts with changing that).

Config entities are stored using the CMI system, i.e. in yaml files in your config folder. Config entity yaml files follow a particular naming convention (prefix) and shipping a module with some default configuration is as easy as creating a new yaml file

Overview of Configuration (vs. other types of information)
Last updated on 22 July 2019
In Drupal 8, there are several types of information:

Content
Information meant to be displayed on your site, and edited by users: article, basic page, images, files, etc.
Session
Information about individual users' interactions with the site, such as their current selection for a Views exposed filter. This is ephemeral and personalized to a single user.
State
Information that can change frequently and/or without user intervention. Examples: the time when Cron was last run, whether node access permissions need rebuilding, etc.
Configuration
Information about your site that is not content and changes infrequently, such as the name of your site, the content types and views you have defined, etc.
Cache
Information about your site that is also stored elsewhere. Caches exist only to speed up data retrieval. They never store canonical data.
Settings
Read-only information for your site hardcoded within settings.php.
