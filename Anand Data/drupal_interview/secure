Use 
t() and 
\Drupal::translation()->formatPlural() 
with @ or % placeholders to construct safe, translatable strings. See Code text translation API in Drupal 8 for more details.


Use Html::escape() for plain text.
Use Xss::filter() for text that should allow some HTML tags.
Use Xss::filterAdmin() for text entered by admin users that should allow most HTML.
Use UrlHelper::stripDangerousProtocols() or UrlHelper::filterBadProtocol() for checking URLs - the former can be used in conjunction with SafeMarkup::format().
